# ELIZA - Python Edition!

## What is this?

Quick summary: this is my version of the [ELIZA](1) conversational robot,
in honor of Weisenbaum.

Artificial Intelligence is really exciting, and I especially find A.I.
that can hold conversations interesting. But making one is hard. Where
would you even start?

In 1966, Weizenbaum wrote [an article](1) about how his conversational
robot works, and I want to try to make something similar to that in Python 3.
Why Python? Because Nao robots are programmable in Python!
